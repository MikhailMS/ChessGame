# ChessGame
## Simple implementation. I have completed the following features :
- [x] Check if the user's input is a legal move, otherwise user should repeat input.
- [x] All pieces moves as you expect them to move, except advanced moves: castling, en passant and pawn promotion
- [x] Added two versions of AI - first moves pieces randomly, second moves pieces such a way so the piece will defeat the highest opponent's piece.
